    "Plagiarism is a widespread issue in today's age of information. It refers to the unauthorized usage of another author's work and representing it as one's own effort without providing due credit. Plagiarism can occur in various mediums like websites, music, video and imaging and professional documents. The extent of plagiarism can also vary from minor modification of another work to outright copying. Nowadays we have instruments such a copyrights that enable one to take legal action if any evidence of plagiarism is found. To make use of such facilities, we must be able to identify cases of malpractice. We can identify these cases by simply comparing content with each other. But given the scale of information we produce nowadays, it is not feasible to manually compare content with each other using simple comparison as the time and energy requirements would be large. Hence the scientfic community has put in significant effort to design and produce efficient solutions to quickly identify cases of plagiarism at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plagiarism among text and image based document is an important issue that the scientific community faces very often. Given that there is large amount of intellectual property being published, effort is made to catch cases of plagiarism to respect the efforts put in by researchers. There are several solutions that have been developed to scan through large directories of documents and pin point cases which show signs of plagiarism.\n",
    "\n",
    "To show why we need efficient solutions that avoid comparing documents one-by-one with each other, assuming we have a large number of documents say n. If we need to compare the similarity between each and every pair, we will need to make $n(n-1)/2$ comparisons. This leads to a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ which is not advisable for a large number of documents. Additionally, to represent a document, we tend to convert documents into single dimension arrays which tell us whether a single word/character or a sequence of words/characters are present in a document along with their frequencies. It is these arrays which we compare when matching pairs of documents. However these arrays tend to be sparse which leads to large memory consumption. Hence efforts have been made to reduce the memory requirements of these naive methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Min-Hashing and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) are two algorithms that can be used to reduce the time and space consumed to efficiently and quickly identify documents which show high levels of similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we attempt to make use of these two algorithm to develop a plagiarism detector. Given a list of of original documents, the solution will learn the text corpus representing these documents. We then provide a list of documents which may or may not be duplicates of these original \"source\" documents. The \"suspicious\" documents are then compared with the source files and tagged as plagiarism if the level of similarity exceeds a threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "The dataset we are using has been obtained from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/gz3hztwm5p/1 which was put together to help the research community develop techniques to detect plagiarism in documents containing images and their associated text. The intuition here is that if an image in a document has been plagiarised, the text pertaining to the image should also be similar. This text includes the caption below the image and text in the main paragraphs that refer to the image. The dataset also includes text which explains the structure of the image but this has not been used as a part of the project. There are 122 source text files, one each for every source image, and 146 suspicious text files, one each for every suspicious image which may or may not be a plagiarism of one of the source images. We also have an annotation .xml file for each suspicious file which tells us whether the suspicious image is truely a plagiarism or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process Flow of Project\n",
    "The steps we followed to implement the project are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data pre-processing such as reading in files and associated annotations\n",
    "- File parsing and data extraction\n",
    "- Converting text into sets using n-grams\n",
    "- Min-hashing the document sets to smaller signatures\n",
    "- LSH to find similar documents (images)\n",
    "- Understanding performance"

    "Our LSH Plagiarism Detector correctly classified 72% of the documents. We started with creating source document vectors of size 19267 to convert the document into a respresentable format. We then used min-hashing to reduce the size of these vectors to 1000 which resulted in memory saving. Further, LSH was used to hash these smaller source signatures into bins such that each bin contained similar documents. We repeated this same process when checking a suspicious document wherein the vectors were based on the source document shingles and the hash functions used for min-hash and LSH on source documents were re-used here. We were hence able to reduce the number of direct comparisons to just the source documents in the bucket to which the suspicious document was hashed to. This is instead of comparing the suspicious document with each and every other source document.\n",

    "Beyond the methodologies used in this project, there is scope to try out additional approaches with the aim of boosting the performance of this solution. We believe the following approaches can be researched upon:\n",
    "- Incorporation of shape based textual reference which descibes the structure of the images. We could create the source document text corpus to include these features and analyse whether inclusion of these geometric information can help better matching. Plagiarised images will ideally have similar geometric information.\n",
